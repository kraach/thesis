EBEX was a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background radiation polarimeter. 
It employed a kilopixel array of transition edge sensor bolometers. 
The bolometer design was modified and optimized for the space-like environment at a float altitude of 36~km. 
The detector characterization measurements, performed in test cryostats and in EBEX itself, are reported here. 
We measured the bolometer normal resistances, thermal conductances, critical temperatures, optical efficiencies, time constants, and noise equivalent powers. 
We also report on the detector performance, with a particular focus on sensitivity and noise, from the 2013 Antarctic flight.
