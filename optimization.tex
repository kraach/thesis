\section{Bolometers}
\label{sec:tes_bolometer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Describe how a bolometer works. Power to temperature detector. Need: cartoon. 

Describe TES. Need: canonical R vs T plot.

Four noise sources, fundamental limit set by photon arrival stats

1. Electronic/Readout
2. Johnson

3. Phonon (ballistic vs É?)

4. Photon (a. Poisson process, b. Shot noise)
