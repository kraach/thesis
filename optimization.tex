Four noise sources, fundamental limit set by photon arrival stats

1. Electronic/Readout

2. Johnson

3. Phonon (ballistic vs É?)

4. Photon (a. Poisson process, b. Shot noise)

\section{Detector Design}
\label{sec:detector_design}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Discuss target detector parameters. Be very clear about which changes were made to fabrication process in order to optimize the detector sensitivity for a space-like environment and for EBEX.

1. Ideal normal resistance.  
The target normal resistance for all bands was 1.5~$\Omega$ in order to ensure the detector, when biased in the transition, remained in the stable regime where the detector electrical bandwidth, determined in part by the resistance, exceeded the \ac{TES} thermal bandwidth by at least XXX (CITE PAPER). THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SPACE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT.

2. Ideal transition temperature for our bath temperature. NEED: PLOT OF PHONON NOISE AS FUNCTION OF TRANSITION TEMPERATURE (GIVEN A FIXED EBEX BATH TEMPERATURE OF 260 MK)

3. Ideal thermal conductance and heat capacity of TES/web 
\begin{itemize}
\item When we set our target $G$, we included a safety factor of 2.5 times the expected load from the \ac{CMB} in case of excess load or fluctuations or other shit. 
\end{itemize}


4. Ideal time constant

\caption{STOLE THIS TABLE FROM THE PAPER FOR NOW. WANT SOMETHING SIMILAR HERE. Designed and measured detector parameters for each of the frequency
bands.  The values in the `measured' columns are median values for 
all detectors on wafers used for flight.  Description of the measurements and histograms and further discussion 
of the measured values are given in Section \ref{sec:detector_characterization}.
For the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Bolometer_Overview} we give the design values. 
The lithography was generally accurate to within 0.5~$\mu$m.
