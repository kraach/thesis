\textcolor{red}{Four noise sources, fundamental limit set by photon arrival stats}

1. Electronic/Readout

2. Johnson

3. Phonon (ballistic vs É?)

4. Photon (a. Poisson process, b. Shot noise)



The sensitivity of the instrument is quantified by the \ac{NEP}. 
\ac{NEP} is defined as the absorbed power required to produce a signal-to-noise ratio of one in an electrical bandwidth of one~Hz. 
%not important?
%Note, sometimes \ac{NEP} is instead defined as the \textit{incident} power required to produce a signal-to-noise ratio of one in an electrical bandwidth of one~Hz, \textcolor{red}{cite who??}.
The predicted detector \ac{NEP}, $N$, is given by 
\begin{equation}
N^{2} = N_{photon}^2 + N_{phonon}^2 + \frac{1}{S_I^2} ( N_{Johnson}^2 + N_{readout}^2 )
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
= 2h\nu P_{rad} + \xi \frac{P_{rad}^2}{\Delta \nu} + \gamma 4k_{B} T^2 G + \frac{1}{S_I^2} (\frac{4k_BT}{R} + N_{readout}^2 )
\label{eq:nep}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $\nu$ is the center of the observation frequency band, $P_{rad}$ is the radiative power absorbed by the bolometer, $\xi$ is a unitless number between zero and one quantifying the contribution of photon correlation noise, $\Delta \nu$ is the width of the observation frequency band, $\gamma$ is a unitless number between zero and one accounting for the temperature gradient along the link from the \ac{TES} to the bath, $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the \ac{TES} temperature, $G$ is the bolometer dynamic thermal conductance, $S_{I}$ is the bolometer current responsivity, and $R$ is the \ac{TES} resistance~\citep{Mather1982a}. 
Figure out how to properly add Mather 1982 applied optics bolometer noise paper to bibfile and reference.

% Detector Design Modifications for Space-Like Environment {{{

\section{Detector Design}
\label{sec:detector_design}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Discuss target detector parameters. Be very clear about which changes were made to fabrication process in order to optimize the detector sensitivity for a space-like environment and for EBEX.

1. Ideal normal resistance.  
The target normal resistance for all bands was 1.5~$\Omega$ in order to ensure the detector, when biased in the transition, remained in the stable regime where the detector electrical bandwidth, determined in part by the resistance, exceeded the \ac{TES} thermal bandwidth by at least XXX (CITE PAPER). THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SPACE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT.

2. Ideal transition temperature for our bath temperature. NEED: PLOT OF PHONON NOISE AS FUNCTION OF TRANSITION TEMPERATURE (GIVEN A FIXED EBEX BATH TEMPERATURE OF 260 MK)

3. Ideal thermal conductance and heat capacity of TES/web 
\begin{itemize}
\item When we set our target $G$, we included a safety factor of 2.5 times the expected load from the \ac{CMB} in case of excess load or fluctuations or other shit. 
\end{itemize}


4. Ideal time constant

bands.  The values in the `measured' columns are median values for 
all detectors on wafers used for flight.  Description of the measurements and histograms and further discussion 
of the measured values are given in Section \ref{sec:detector_characterization}.
For the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Bolometer_Overview} we give the design values. 
The lithography was generally accurate to within 0.5~$\mu$m.
