Describe how a bolometer works. Power to temperature detector. Need: cartoon. 

Describe TES.

Four noise sources, fundamental limit set by photon arrival stats

1. Electronic/Readout

2. Johnson

3. Phonon (ballistic vs É?)

4. Photon (a. Poisson process, b. Shot noise)

\section{Detector Design Modifications}
\label{sec:detector_mods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Discuss which changes were made to fabrication process in order to optimize the detector sensitivity for a space-like environment and for EBEX.

1. Ideal normal resistance 

2. Ideal transition temperature for our bath temperature

3. Ideal thermal conductance and heat capacity of TES/web

4. Ideal time constant
