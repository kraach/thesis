This entire chapter is postponed until I have a substantial amount of the data analysis completed and written up.

% CMB Science {{{

\section{Cosmic Microwave Background}
\label{sec:cmb_science}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There was a big bang. Some gravity waves were probably generated. They left a signature polarization pattern on the CMB.

% CMB Polarization {{{

\section{Polarization}
\label{sec:polarization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Measurements of the E-mode polarization have informed us about the evolution of universe. 
Measurements of B-mode polarization due to primordial gravity waves would tell us about the earliest moments in the history of the universe. (and interesting things like the energy scale of inflation and may confirm or rule out expansion models).
Measurements of B-mode polarization due to other stuff tells us about that other stuff.

Some other folks are working on this very same thing, too.
But. This doesn't even belong here.

%\begin{itemize}
%
%%\item Chapter 1 introduces the analytic goals pursued in this thesis.
%
%\item Chapter 2 briefly presents the history of, and science behind, the
%subjects presented in this thesis.
%
%\item In Chapter 3 the experiment is outlined.
%
%\item Chapter 4 describes the simulation process used in the analysis.
%
%\item Chapter 5 follows the chain of reconstruction software used to obtain
%meaningful results from data.
%
%\item Chapter 6 hashes out the strategy for analysis and presents the data and
%simulated sets that will be used in the analysis.
%
%\item Chapter 7 demonstrates the implementation of the event selection
%processes.
%
%\item In Chapter 8 those events selected in Chapter 7 are analyzed.
%
%\item Chapter 9 presents a final discussion of the analyses presented in the
%thesis.
