% CMB Science {{{

\section{Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation}
\label{sec:cmb_science}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There was a big bang. Some gravity waves were probably generated. They may have left a signature polarization pattern on the \ac{CMB}. 

Measurements of the E-mode polarization (due to things that are not primordial gravity waves) have informed us about the evolution of universe. 
Measurements of B-mode polarization due to primordial gravity waves would tell us about the earliest moments in the history of the universe. (and interesting things like the energy scale of inflation and may confirm or rule out expansion models).
Measurements of B-mode polarization due to other stuff tells us about that other stuff.

% High-Altitude Ballooning {{{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{High-Altitude Ballooning}
\label{sec:balloons}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Explain the motivation for flying a CMB telescope from a high-altitude balloon. 
The advantages. 
The disadvantages. 

Balloons are powerful platforms for achieving low budget and fast (relative to satellites!) astrophysical studies. The high altitude observation environment enables measurement of frequencies inaccessible on the ground ($>$ 350 GHz?).
