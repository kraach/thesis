%The continuously rotating half-wave plate leaves an optical signal (at [$\1*f_{hwp_rotation}, 2*f_{hwp_rotation}, ..., n*f_{hwp_rotation}$]). 4f and 2f are physically motivated by ... . 1f is there because of rotation. Other harmonics are present because ... . This optical half-wave plate signal is 

The polarized signal we are after resides in the sidebands of 4*f. Put there by the modulation of the gondola scanning sky. 

Our goal is to remove the \ac{HWP} signal from the timestreams such that the residual template is within the detector white noise level in the optical signal band. 

%We model the template as:

%$\[\beta_t] = \sum_{n=1}^{10}$
