@article{Mather1998a,
abstract = {The photometric errors of the external calibrator for the FIRAS instrument on the COBE are smaller than the measurement errors on the cosmic microwave background (CMBR) spectrum (typically 0.02 MJy/sr, 1 sigma), and smaller than 0.01\% of the peak brightness of the CMBR. The calibrator is a re-entrant cone, shaped like a trumpet mute, made of Eccosorb iron-loaded epoxy. It fills the entire beam of the instrument and is the source of its accuracy. Its known errors are caused by reflections, temperature gradients, and leakage through the material and around the edge. Estimates and limits are given for all known error sources. Improvements in understanding the temperature measurements of the calibrator allow an improved CMBR temperature determination of 2.725 +/- 0.002 K.},

@article{Peterson1984a,
abstract = {We describe a cryogenic blackbody reference, or cold load for millimeter wavelength radiation. This blackbody has an emissivity $\epsilon$ $\gamma$ 0.99 over a two octave wavelength range. We use it as a standard when calibrating sensitive infrared photometers. The particular geometry of the blackbody described is influenced by our application. The basic design data and philosophy are described so that other designs can be evaluated.},
